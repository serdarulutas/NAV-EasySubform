# NAVAutomation
A dll component that allows communication between NAV objects (e.g. parent/subform) by using Automation Event triggers. 

# Description
In Dynamics NAV (Navision), accessing a parent form from a subform has its challenges. This dll component allows a sort of communication between forms even if they are unrelated. One form can fire a one of the three automation events (Event1, Event2 or Event3) of another form.
